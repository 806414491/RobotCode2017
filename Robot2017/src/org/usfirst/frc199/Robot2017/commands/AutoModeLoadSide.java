/**
 * This is to be used if starting on the load side,
 * with back left corner of robot at the inside (closest to center-field) 
 * corner of tape
 * 
 * 
 * Summary:
 * The robot drives forward, turns 60 degrees to be parallel with the
 * desired lift, drives forward to the lift, auto-aligns, and then
 * the gear is taken (5 seconds allotted)
 * 
 * Next, it reverses the path it took to the boiler, turns away from
 * the boiler and backs up towards it, then shoots
 *
